# T560 Music Panel

A native touch-only controller for the Samsung Galaxy Tab E SM-T560
(`gtelwifi`, ARMv7) running postmarketOS and Openbox. It follows the interaction
model of the
[VahaC Music Assistant ESP32 controller](https://github.com/VahaC/music-assistant-esp32s34848s040-controller),
but runs as a lightweight GTK3 application on the tablet.

The application does not use WebKit, a browser, HTML/JavaScript, text fields,
or an on-screen keyboard. All settings are edited over SSH.

## Implemented features

- Native dark UI designed for the 800x1219 usable screen area.
- The window runs fullscreen and covers the whole display, without
  decorations or window manager panels above it.
- A header row with the page title, a centered clock showing the time and
  the date, a Home Assistant link icon, and an upright battery indicator
  with the charge percentage.
- The battery indicator turns green and shows a bolt while the tablet is
  charging, and amber or red as the charge drops.
- The link icon reports only whether Home Assistant answers. It is teal and
  whole while every configured entity is read, amber and whole when Home
  Assistant replies but rejects a request, and red and broken only when the
  server cannot be reached at all. A wrong entity ID in `config.ini` is
  therefore reported as amber, never as a lost connection. Hold the icon to
  read a tooltip naming the entity that Home Assistant rejected.
- Album art, track title, artist, playback progress, and volume.
- Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Volume Down, and Volume Up controls.
- Shuffle and Repeat Off/All/One controls.
- Queue browsing and playback of a selected queue item without replacing the queue.
- Playlist browsing and playback through `music_assistant.play_media`.
- Light 1, Light 2, Fan, AC, Desk Lamp, and Desk LED Strip room controls.
- Configurable brightness and color-temperature adjustment for any room light.
- Direct Home Assistant REST API access without loading Lovelace.
- A separate token file with `0600` permissions.
- Watchdog, desktop entry, Openbox rule, and ARMv7 `APKBUILD`.
- A dedicated launcher icon installed into the `hicolor` icon theme, so the
  desktop launcher and the task bar show the panel icon. The icon is
  regenerated from geometry by `tools/make-app-icon.py`.
- A short Power press turns the display off; any key or touchscreen input wakes it.
- The tap that wakes the display only wakes it: the button handler holds a
  pointer grab while the display is off, so no control is pressed by mistake.
- The display turns off automatically after a configurable inactivity timeout
  (`screen_off_seconds`, 30 seconds by default).
- Camera motion detection: movement turns the display on while it is off, and
  postpones the automatic screen off while it continues. It is off by default
  because the built-in camera of this tablet cannot stream to userspace; see
  [CAMERA.md](docs/CAMERA.md).
- Camera analysis runs in a separate low-priority daemon, never in the panel
  process, and the panel keeps working when no camera node is usable.
- The physical Home button toggles between the panel and desktop while the
  display is on, and only wakes the display while it is off.
- The existing long-press Power menu is retained.

## Tablet configuration files

```text
~/.config/t560-music-panel/config.ini
~/.config/t560-music-panel/token
```

The first-installation procedure transfers [config.ini.example](config/config.ini.example)
into the user-owned configuration directory. Replace every placeholder with
the entity IDs created by Home Assistant and the Media Controller integration.
Put the long-lived access token in the separate `token` file. Never commit the
token.

Room adjustment controls are enabled per tile in the `[room_features]` section.
The supported values are `brightness` and `color_temperature`, separated by a
comma. Under the normal watchdog launch, saving a valid `config.ini`
automatically restarts only the panel process within about two seconds. The
tablet does not reboot. An invalid intermediate file keeps the current panel
running and reports the configuration error in the log.

The Media Controller integration from the ESP32 controller repository must be
installed and configured in Home Assistant first. It creates the queue and
playlist sensors and the room proxy entities consumed by this application.

## Source architecture

The application is split into focused C modules with explicit interfaces:

- `application` owns the application lifecycle and coordinates UI events with
  Home Assistant state;
- `app_config` validates and owns configuration data;
- `home_assistant_client` encapsulates authenticated asynchronous HTTP I/O;
- `panel_ui` builds and updates GTK widgets without knowing API details;
- `json_helpers` contains reusable, unit-tested JSON accessors;
- `system_status` reads the battery charge and charging state from
  `/sys/class/power_supply`;
- `main` is the minimal process entry point.

Two Python helpers run beside the application. `t560-power-button.py` owns
DPMS: it handles the Power and Home buttons, the inactivity timeout, and the
motion events. `t560-motion-detector.py` captures camera frames and reports
motion to that handler with `SIGUSR2`.

The Makefile tracks header dependencies automatically. Run `make test` for the
unit tests and `make` for the application.

## Build and installation

The complete guide contains two end-to-end procedures:

- first installation on an unmodified tablet user account;
- updating an existing installation without replacing configuration or tokens.

See [BUILD_AND_INSTALL.md](docs/BUILD_AND_INSTALL.md).

The repository root already contains a verified `t560-panel` binary. It is a
44 KB ELF 32-bit ARM EABI5/musl executable built in a clean Alpine 3.20 ARMv7
container. The source also compiles successfully on x86_64 Alpine as an API
compatibility check. Checksums are stored in `SHA256SUMS`.

The recommended deployment is rootless. The executable and launch scripts are
installed below `/home/vahac/.local`, and files are transferred through the
existing SSH connection without requiring SCP, SFTP, or administrative access.

## Openbox autostart

The ready-to-use [t560-openbox-autostart](openbox/t560-openbox-autostart)
starts Tint2, the cursor helper, the included Power button handler, and the
camera motion detector. A short Power press turns the display off, while any
key, touchscreen input, or detected motion wakes it. The same handler makes
Home screen-aware and retains the existing long-press Power menu. The autostart
does not start Badwolf, WebKit, or Matchbox Keyboard. Back up the current
autostart file before replacing it.

The first-installation procedure transfers the provided file as a candidate,
backs up the current Openbox autostart, tests the panel, and activates the new
autostart only after the test succeeds. The configuration helper changes only
the `Home` and `XF86HomePage` key bindings in `rc.xml` and keeps a backup.

## Alpine APK

The [APKBUILD](packaging/APKBUILD) limits the package to `armv7`. APK packaging
is optional and is not the recommended installation method on the current
tablet because it requires intentionally configured administrative access.

## Camera motion detection

`t560-motion-detector.py` captures the front camera through V4L2 at 320x240 and
2.5 FPS by default, compares consecutive frames as a 16x12 grid of block
averages, and reports confirmed motion to the button handler. A frame-wide
brightness change, such as a room light or the backlight itself, is subtracted
before the comparison and does not count as motion. The daemon needs only the
Python standard library and no OpenCV or neural-network runtime.

Every setting lives in the `[camera]` section of `config.ini`.
`motion_detection` is `off` by default: the `/dev/video0` DCAM shim of the
SM-T560 rejects `VIDIOC_REQBUFS`, so no application can capture frames from
the built-in sensor under the 3.10.17 kernel. `t560-motion-detector.py
--probe` reports each node and the exact call at which capture stops, and the
feature works as soon as a camera answers it with `capture works`, for example
a USB camera on the OTG port.

The measured driver behaviour, the architecture, and the tuning notes are
documented in [CAMERA.md](docs/CAMERA.md), and the kernel and root filesystem
changes that would make the built-in camera usable are listed in
[CAMERA_FIRMWARE.md](docs/CAMERA_FIRMWARE.md). Object recognition should still run
on a more powerful LAN server after the tablet detects motion.
